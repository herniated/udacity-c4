# udacity-c4

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# How to run the application

## Backend

The backend has already been deployed.  The frontend has been configured to worj with the deployed backend.

## Frontend

To run the client application, run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO backend.
